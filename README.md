I have in mind a project relating to a parkrun challenge called p-index.
I am currently maintaining a database in a large Excel spreadsheet.
The results of which are currently published in a Google Sheets page and shared in a Facebook group.
parkrun recently asked Google to take down the original spreadsheet, which they did.
The spreadsheet is updated by using Power Query to download data from parkrun.
parkrun do not allow (approve) of data scraping there website. 
The data is scraped but in small chunks (~50 parkrunners) every 5 minutes. 
It is currently quite a manual process, despite the power query automation.

I thought this would be an opportunity to renew my skills in publishing a website whilst also learning
some new database skills. I have purchase a 1 year subscription for the domain pindex.club which includes
5 MySQL databases and email facilities
